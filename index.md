* Lab 2 part 1

     I found Lab 2 to be one of my favorites becasue I liked how we got the experience of learning how to code with std::cout and std::sin. I was confusing at first, hoever when we applied it to our work we were able to make more sense of it. I also liked how
  
* Lab 4 part 2

     I liked Lab 4 part 2 because we were able to create a small fun guessing game. I thought that this was pretty cool and we even got to play it to test that our code worked. Part 1 of the lab was kinda fun but it had more to do with measurements which wasn't really fun.
  
* Lab 8 part 1

     I found Lab 8 part 1 fun because we got to work with double functions and see how they contributed in making loops. I also liked how my partner was able to help me and how we sent a lot of time coding together and getting to know one another. I also found it satisfing that we were able to gerenerate a code that produced a score from a judge.
